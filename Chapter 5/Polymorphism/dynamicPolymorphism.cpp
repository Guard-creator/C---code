// dynamic polymorphism 
// you can also called it function overriding or virtual function

// This is a form of runtime polymorphism where a base class pointer or reference 
// can be used to call a function that is overridden in a derived class. The correct 
// function to call is determined at runtime based on the actual object type.

// From me... -> |

// overridng happen when derived class inherieted from base class 
// and same function name override the base class function means ignore the 
// function of base class and take from derived class

  // The virtual keyword allows this function to be
  //  overridden in derived classes.

  // ensures that the function is actually overriding 
  // a base class function.

  // The primary reason for using pointers or references is to achieve runtime polymorphism. 
  // This means that the decision about which function to call (base class or derived class) 
  // is made at runtime based on the actual object type, not the type of the pointer or reference.
